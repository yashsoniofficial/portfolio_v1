A reinforcement learning-based framework designed for trajectory planning of a UR5e robotic arm operating in dynamic and constrained environments, Developed in CoppeliaSim, the system integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDP), and Fuzzy Movement Primitives (FMP) to enable the robot to reach randomly placed goals while effectively avoiding moving obstacles, The hybrid control architecture combines learned behavior with real-time reactive adjustments, allowing the agent to generate smooth, collision-free trajectories closely aligned with inverse kinematics predictions, This approach is well-suited for future applications involving multi-arm robot coordination in complex industrial or collaborative settings.
