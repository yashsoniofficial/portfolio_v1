A three-wheeled omni-directional robotic system designed to assist visually impaired individuals as a cost-effective alternative to traditional service animals, The robot is equipped with ultrasonic sensors enabling 360Â° obstacle detection and supports real-time SLAM capabilities to guide users safely through complex environments. Built using a dual Arduino (master-slave) architecture, the system transmits sensor data to a connected computer running a Python-based SLAM and DATMO framework. The hardware features custom laser-cut and 3D-printed components, emphasizing modularity and scalability for broader deployment in assistive robotics applications.
