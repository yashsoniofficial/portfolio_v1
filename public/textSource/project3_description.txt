A competition-based robotics project where two autonomous robots were designed to participate in ABU Robocon 2021, themed on the traditional East Asian game "pitch-pot." As Mechanical Department Head, I led the full design and manufacturing process, including CAD modeling, mechanism design, and integration with electronics and microcontrollers. The robots featured lightweight aluminum and 3D-printed components, used pneumatic cylinders for actuation, and were controlled using Arduino boards with wireless communication via PS5 controllers. Software was written in C++ (Arduino IDE), and robots followed real-time game strategy.
