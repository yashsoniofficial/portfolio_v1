One of my first robotics projects, this involved building an autonomous line-following robot using an Arduino UNO, IR array sensors, and DC motors. The robot navigated predefined tracks using PID control logic and was optimized for speed and stability. The project secured 1st place in a local competition and laid the foundation for deeper exploration into embedded systems and motion control.
