Led the design and integration of a custom drone assembly for flag hoisting mid-flight. As Club President, I oversaw drone fabrication, payload optimization, and remote-controlled flag deployment mechanism. Two drones were built â€” one for prototyping and one for final execution. The project provided a valuable hands-on experience in aerial robotics and control systems.
