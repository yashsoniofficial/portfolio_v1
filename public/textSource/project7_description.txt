A project focused on designing and automating a test rig to study torsional vibrations in rotating shafts, The system integrated sensors and actuators using Arduino and ESP32 boards, enabling real-time data acquisition through MPU6050 sensors. Collected data was logged to Firebase via Wi-Fi, and the entire setup was remotely controlled through a custom-built web interface. The project facilitated analysis of natural frequencies and node points under various conditions, offering a remotely accessible platform for real-time experimental testing.
