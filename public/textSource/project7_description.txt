This project involved designing and automating a test rig to study torsional vibrations in rotating shafts. I integrated sensors and actuators with Arduino and ESP32 boards, allowing real-time data collection through MPU6050 sensors. Data was logged to Firebase using Wi-Fi, and the test rig was controlled via a custom-built web interface. The project explored natural frequencies and node points under varying conditions and provided a remote interface for real-time testing.
