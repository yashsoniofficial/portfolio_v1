A three-wheeled omni-directional robotic system developed to assist visually impaired individuals as a cost-effective alternative to traditional service animals. Equipped with ultrasonic sensors for 360Â° obstacle detection and real-time SLAM capabilities, the robot guides users safely through complex environments. Built using dual Arduino boards (master-slave), the system processes sensor data on a connected computer running a Python-based SLAM + DATMO framework. The hardware includes custom laser-cut and 3D-printed parts, with a focus on modular design and scalable architecture for broader assistive robotics applications.
