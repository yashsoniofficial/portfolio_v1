An early robotics project focused on building an autonomous line-following robot using an Arduino UNO, IR array sensors, and DC motors. The robot was programmed with PID control logic to navigate predefined tracks efficiently, with tuning optimized for both speed and stability. The project earned first place in a local competition and served as a foundational experience in embedded systems, sensor integration, and motion control.
