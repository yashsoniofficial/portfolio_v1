Developed to automate a mechanical lab experiment involving universal joints. I led the electronics and data acquisition system using MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer sensors connected to Arduino UNO boards. A wireless master-slave communication system using Bluetooth (HC-05) was implemented to collect angular frequency and torque data in rotating shafts. I2C multiplexing allowed simultaneous sensor readings and the entire system was used for error-free student experimentation.
