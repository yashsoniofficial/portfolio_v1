A system developed to automate a mechanical laboratory experiment involving universal joints. The electronics and data acquisition system was designed using MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer sensors connected to Arduino UNO boards. A wireless master-slave communication setup, implemented using Bluetooth (HC-05) modules, enabled the collection of angular frequency and torque data from rotating shafts. I2C multiplexing facilitated simultaneous sensor readings, resulting in a streamlined and error-free experimental process for student use.
